# Initial Dataset to motivate machine learning principles. Data had three values: g-r color, r-i color and days after explosion.
# Explored 4 different types of classifiers: Naives Bayes, Support Vector Machines (Radial Basis Function), Neural Net and 
# Random Forests. Plotted Decision Boundaries and made Confusion matrices for all mentioned classifiers. Also looked at
# feature importance with Random Forest.
