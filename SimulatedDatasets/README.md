New Datasets Simulating the light curves of Type Ia, Type II (Core Collapse) and Type Ib/Ic (Striped Envelope).

Recreated Dataset with information only close to the time of explosion.
Performed some initial Analysis by looking at variation in magnitude and color across various days from explosion.
Performed PCA and created Confusion Matrices using the SVM RBF classifiers.
Created Correlation matrices.
Also Looking at dimensionality reduction.
